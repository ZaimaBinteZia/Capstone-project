        <p>The Great Wall of China is one of the most iconic landmarks in the world, renowned for its immense scale and
            historical
            significance. It is a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other
            materials, stretching
            over 13,000 miles across northern China. The wall was constructed to protect Chinese states and empires from
            invasions
            and raids by nomadic groups from the north.</p>

        <h5>Roman Colosseum</h5>

        <p>The Roman Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheater, is an iconic symbol of ancient Rome. Located in
            the heart
            of Rome, Italy, it was commissioned by Emperor Vespasian in AD 70â€“72 and completed by his son Titus in AD
            80. This
            massive amphitheater, capable of seating up to 80,000 spectators, was used for gladiatorial contests, public
            spectacles,
            and various entertainments, such as animal hunts and mock naval battles. The Colosseum is an architectural
            marvel, with its elliptical shape, complex system of arches and vaults, and advanced
            engineering techniques for crowd control and stage effects. It remains a powerful testament to Roman
            ingenuity and
            grandeur, attracting millions of visitors each year.</p>
